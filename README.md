# Hi there!!

### [Enigma](https://enigma.com/)🔗
"Enigma provides foundational ground-truth data on businesses, built on unparalleled entity resolution. Win markets, verify business customers faster, and power AI with ground truth intelligence." I choose Enigma as my dataset because of the sheer volume of data that they host. Billions of public records are easily accessible at your fingertips from sources like companies to different organizations to even different governments across the world. This information could be extremely valuable for a variety of different research applications but the value it can bring to AI and Machine Learning would greatly enhance any model.


### [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/interactive-data-visualization/9781449340223/)🔗
The data science book I chose is “Interactive Data Visualization for the Web” by Scott Murray (2013). I picked this book for a few reasons, firstly it was described to be understandable for people with a “Beginner to Intermediate” understanding of data science and I thought that it would help me learn new topics but also build on them enough that I could finish the book with questions and new topics to research to continue learning. Next, the book provides a step-by-step guide about creating and publishing “your own interactive data visualization projects on the Web,” and a tangible project which I could add to my portfolio is something that I find a good investment of time.
